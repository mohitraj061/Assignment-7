    "The feature responsible for generating Regex objects, typically used for regular expression pattern matching and manipulation,\n",

    "* Python : The 're' module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions. We can use the re.compile() \n",
    "           function to generate a Regex object from a given pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Java : The java.util.regex package provides classes for working with regular expressions. We can use the Pattern.compile()\n",
    "         method to create a Regex object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* JavaScript : The RegExp object is built-in in JavaScript and allows you to work with regular expressions directly. We can \n",
    "            create a Regex object using the new RegExp() constructor or by using regular expression literals (e.g., /pattern/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ruby : In Ruby, regular expressions are built into the language syntax. We can create a Regex object by enclosing the \n",
    "         pattern in forward slashes (e.g., /pattern/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* .NET (C#) : The System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace provides classes for working with regular expressions in C#.\n",
    "              We can use the Regex class to create a Regex object by calling the constructor with the desired pattern.\n",

    "Ques 2.) Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution :\n",
    "    \n",
    "Raw strings are often used in regular expressions to avoid excessive use of escape characters. In many programming languages,\n",
    "including Python, backslashes () are commonly used as escape characters. However, in regular expressions, backslashes are also \n",
    "used as metacharacters to give special meaning to certain characters or character sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a raw string (prefixed with the letter 'r'), we can create a string literal in which backslashes are treated as\n",
    "literal characters rather than escape characters. This makes it easier to write and read regular expressions because we don't\n",
    "need to double escape special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to match a literal backslash followed by a lowercase 'n' using a regular expression. Without \n",
    "using a raw string, we would need to escape the backslash itself and the 'n', resulting in four backslashes :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pattern = '\\\\\\\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "However, by using a raw string, we can write the pattern more clearly without the need for extra escaping :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pattern = r'\\\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw string notation allows us to write regular expressions in a more concise and readable way, reducing the clutter of\n",
    "excessive backslashes. It is especially useful when dealing with complex patterns that contain many special characters or when\n",
    "working with file paths, URLs, or other string formats that frequently include backslashes."

    "match is found. The specific details of the returned match object may vary depending on the programming language or library\n",
    "being used.\n",
    "\n",
